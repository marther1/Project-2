        <p>
          My name is Mohmedamir Arther but, you'll can call me Amir. I'm currently
          19 years old and at the moment working on getting a bachelor's degree in
          Information Technology and Management (ITM) as an undergraduate at
          Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). I live on the north side of
          Chicago, about an hour an a half away from miles campus therefore, I am only on
          campus 2 days a week. My favorite subjects are: Math, Science, and "Technology".

        <p>
          A little more than a year ago, the summer of 2016, I spent about two weeks in my
          uncle's backyard building a porch. A few of my cousins and I built a porch using
          my uncle (a civil engineer) as a guide. It wasn't like building a skyscraper but,
          it was something in its own. My job was to cut the wood plank the right size and
          hammer/drill them in the right place. Because we had to built the porch on a
          slanted pavement it was a great challenge. It was a very dangerous surrounding
          at that time, wood chips were flying everywhere, nails were all over the place,
          etc. Actually, one of my cousin stepped on a nail and it went through his shoe
          into the sole of his foot. Because of this incident I almost got dismissed from
          the project but, i didn't give up neither did my cousin. And being very careful
          and precise my cousins and I finished building it.
